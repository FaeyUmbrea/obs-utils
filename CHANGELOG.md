- Introduced keybindings support for OBS Utils. Users can now switch director modes via keyboard shortcuts.

### Fixed
- Tracking logic revised to only track a camera if the scene matches that of the stream user, ensuring better synchronization and performance.

## Version 3.0.4

### Fixes:
- Improved `ProgressBarComponent` to handle invalid numerical values gracefully by assigning default values. If the current value is invalid, the progress bar will now show `0.5`, and if the maximum value is invalid, its maximum value will be set to `1`.

This ensures that the progress bar displays valid data and avoids rendering issues caused by incorrect numerical inputs.

- Progress Bar Component that can show an evaluated progress bar to visualize HP and similar values.

### Changed:
- Boolean AV Icon Component now has changeable icons.

### Fixed:
- MultiIcon and MultiImage component editors would break under certain conditions.
- Some components would incorrectly unregister a listener on the wrong event, causing hooks to malfunction.

## Version 2.9.0

### Added:
- Export and Import for Overlay Settings.

## Version 2.8.5

## Version 2.8.1
