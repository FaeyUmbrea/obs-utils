# OBS Utils

This module was developed specifically for using OBS Browsers Sources as a spectator client for your FoundryVTT Game

It forgoes the usual stream user configuration by simply checking if its running in a browser source.
Changing any of the settings related to the Browser Source will also force-refresh it in OBS, so no need to do that manually anymore.

This Module was in large parts inspired by Stream View and Stream Utils respectively.

## Concept

This module is supposed to be easy, low config and out of the box. 
Most importantly its supposed to be as hands off on the OBS Side as possible.
